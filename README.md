## üí° The Problem

Independent game developers create incredible games, but often struggle with marketing and visibility. Their development journey‚Äîthe bugs, the breakthroughs, the art‚Äîis a compelling story that gets lost across scattered social media posts or buried deep inside store pages. Players who want to connect with the "making-of" process have no central place to do so.

## ‚ú® The Solution: IndieFable

IndieFable tackles this problem by providing a dual-purpose platform:

* **For Players:** A beautiful, visual-first showcase to discover new and upcoming indie games. It's a catalog of creativity where you can find your next favorite game.
* **For Developers:** A free and powerful tool to build a community *while* you build your game. By sharing your development story through devlogs, you turn your process into your best marketing tool, building hype and connecting with players long before launch.

## üöÄ Core Features

* **üéÆ Indie Game Showcase:** A player-focused homepage featuring a grid of indie games, designed for easy discovery.
* **üìñ Project Pages:** Every game gets a dedicated page featuring its trailer, screenshots, description, and purchase/wishlist links.
* **üìú Devlog Journey:** Right below the main showcase info on each game page, players can scroll through the entire development history‚Äîfrom concept art to the latest updates.
* **‚úçÔ∏è Easy Devlog Publishing:** A simple, Markdown-supported editor for developers to post updates with rich text and images.
* **üîí Secure Authentication:** Easy and secure sign-up/login for developers using Google or GitHub.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
