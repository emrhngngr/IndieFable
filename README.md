## üí° The Problem

Independent game developers create incredible games, but often struggle with marketing and visibility. With thousands of new titles released every year on platforms like Steam and Itch.io, it's impossible for players to find the truly special games. Many "hidden gems" get buried in the noise and are never discovered.

## ‚ú® The Solution: IndieFable

IndieFable is a **simple, beautiful, and manually curated showcase** of the best indie games. Think of it as a personal 'quality filter' for the indie scene.

Instead of an algorithm, this platform is run by a passionate human (me!) who personally reviews game submissions. The goal isn't to be the biggest catalog; it's to be the **best-tasting** one.

If a game is featured on IndieFable, it's because it's special and deserves your attention. The mission is simple: **help a few great indie games find a few more players.**

## üöÄ Core Features

* **‚ú® Hand-Picked Curation:** Every game on this site is reviewed and selected by a human.
* **üéÆ Beautiful Showcase:** A clean, visual-first grid layout that lets the games' art and trailers shine.
* **üîó Simple Submission:** An easy-to-use form for developers to submit their game for review.
* **üè∑Ô∏è Genre & Tag Filtering:** Simple filtering to help players find the exact kind of game they love.
